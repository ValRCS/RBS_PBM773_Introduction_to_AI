    "\n",
    "An agent, as defined in 2.1, is anything that can perceive its <b>environment</b> through sensors, and act upon that environment through actuators based on its <b>agent program</b>. This can be a dog, a robot, or even you. As long as you can perceive the environment and act on it, you are an agent. This notebook will explain how to implement a simple agent, create an environment, and implement a program that helps the agent act on the environment based on its percepts.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    * `bump`: which tracks if the agent collides with an edge of the environment (for eg, a wall in a park)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * `holding`: which is a list containing the `Things` an agent is holding, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * `performance`: which evaluates the performance metrics of the agent \n",

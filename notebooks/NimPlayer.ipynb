        "*   **Were the `is_losing_state` and `minmax_player` functions successfully implemented?**\n",
        "    Yes, both functions were successfully implemented according to the game theory rules for misere Nim.\n",
        "*   **Was the `minmax_player` integrated and tested within the `nim_game` function?**\n",
        "    Yes, the `minmax_player` was integrated into the `nim_game` function as the computer opponent and tested, demonstrating its ability to make optimal moves.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `is_losing_state` function was defined to determine a losing position in misere Nim, returning `True` if `matches % (MAX_MOVE + 1) == 0`.\n",
        "*   The `minmax_player` function was implemented to identify the optimal move by iterating through all legal moves and utilizing `is_losing_state` to find a move that leaves the opponent in a losing state.\n",
        "*   The `minmax_player`'s fallback logic was refined to simply make the smallest legal move when no immediate winning move is found, ensuring a valid play even in losing positions.\n",
        "*   The `nim_game` function was successfully modified to accept the `minmax_player` as the computer opponent, and the win condition was correctly set for misere Nim.\n",
        "*   Testing demonstrated that the \"Smart Agent\" (using `minmax_player`) consistently made optimal moves, such as taking 1 match to leave 20 (a losing state for the opponent), leading to the computer player (\"Player A\") winning the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current implementation provides an unbeatable AI for Nim, making the game predictable for the human player.\n",
        "*   To enhance user experience, consider adding a difficulty setting for the computer player, potentially by introducing a probability for the `minmax_player` to make a non-optimal move.\n"

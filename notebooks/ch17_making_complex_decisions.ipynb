    "## **Introduction** \n",
    "- Focus on methods for making decisions today that account for potential future decisions.\n",
    "- Addresses computational issues in decision-making within stochastic environments, contrasting with one-shot decision problems discussed in Chapter 16.\n",
    "- Emphasizes sequential decision problems where an agent's utility depends on a series of decisions, integrating utilities, uncertainty, sensing, and encompassing search and planning problems. \n",
    "- Outlines the structure of the chapter:\n",
    "- Section 17.1: Definition of sequential decision problems.\n",
    "- Section 17.2: Methods for solving sequential decision problems suitable for stochastic environments.\n",
    "- Section 17.3: Discussion on multi-armed bandit problems, highlighting their significance and prevalence.\n",
    "- Section 17.4: Examination of decision problems in partially observable environments.\n",
    "- Section 17.5: Strategies for solving problems in partially observable contexts"

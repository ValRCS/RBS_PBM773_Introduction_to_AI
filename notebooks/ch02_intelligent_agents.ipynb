    "   - **Example**: Consider a chess-playing AI. Rationality in this context means choosing the best move based on the current state of the board, the rules of chess, and its programmed strategy. The AI does not need to predict future moves perfectly; it just needs to make the best move considering what it knows at that moment.\n",
    "- **Rationality vs. Perfection**\n",
    "   - **Example**: Imagine a weather prediction AI. It makes forecasts based on current data and models. A rational weather AI may predict rain, which is a reasonable conclusion based on the data. However, if unforeseen conditions change and it doesn't rain, the AI's decision was still rational, even though the outcome wasn't perfect.\n",

    "   - **Example**: In a stock trading AI, the performance measure might be maximizing financial return. A rational decision in this scenario would be one that maximizes expected returns based on available market data. However, if the performance measure was to minimize risk, the AI's decisions might be different, focusing more on safe investments.\n",
    "- **Rationality in Different Environments**\n",
    "   - **Example**: For an autonomous car navigating in a controlled environment (like a well-mapped, low-traffic area), rational behavior involves straightforward route planning and obstacle avoidance. However, the same car in a dynamic, unpredictable environment (like a busy city center) requires more complex rational behavior, such as responding to unexpected pedestrian movements or navigating around sudden road closures.\n",

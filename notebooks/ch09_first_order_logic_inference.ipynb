    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will discuss how to perform inference in first-order logic. We will discuss the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unification\n",
    "- Forward chaining\n",
    "- Backward chaining\n",
    "- Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Section 9.1** is highlighted for introducing inference rules specifically for quantifiers and for demonstrating methods to reduce first-order inference to propositional inference. This reduction, however, may come at a significant computational cost.\n",
    "- **Section 9.2** is mentioned for its focus on unification, a process by which inference rules can be directly applied to first-order sentences without reducing them to propositional logic.\n",
    "- The chapter promises to delve into three major families of first-order inference algorithms:\n",
    "   - **Forward chaining** (detailed in Section 9.3) is a data-driven approach that applies inference rules to the known data to derive new information.\n",
    "   - **Backward chaining** (covered in Section 9.4) works in a goal-driven manner, starting from the goal and working backward to determine if the available data supports the goal.\n",
    "   - **Resolution-based theorem proving** (explored in Section 9.5) is presented as a powerful method for deducing new truths by resolving contradictions in a set of premises.\n"

    "## 9.1 Propositional vs. First-Order Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This section compares propositional logic inference with first-order logic inference, highlighting methods to transition from the complexity of first-order logic to the simpler propositional logic to leverage existing inference techniques.\n",
    "- It introduces the concept of **Universal Instantiation (UI)**, which allows for the derivation of specific instances from general universal statements. The process involves substituting a ground term (a term without variables) for every universally quantified variable in a statement. For example, from the axiom that all greedy kings are evil, one can infer specific instances for any king by replacing the variable with a concrete term, such as John or Richard.\n",
    "- The formal rule for UI involves the use of substitutions, denoted as SUBST(θ,α), applying a substitution θ to a sentence α, effectively replacing variables with ground terms to generate specific assertions from general ones.\n",
    "- **Existential Instantiation** is discussed as a counterpart to UI, focusing on existentially quantified statements. It involves substituting existentially quantified variables with a unique constant (Skolem constant), effectively naming an otherwise unspecified entity. This process turns abstract existential claims into concrete statements about specific entities, as long as the newly introduced constant has not been previously used within the knowledge base.\n",
    "- The text emphasizes the operational difference between Universal and Existential Instantiation: while UI can be applied repeatedly to generate multiple specific conclusions from a single general premise, Existential Instantiation is typically applied once per existentially quantified sentence, after which the original sentence can be discarded.\n",
    "- The section illustrates these concepts with examples, such as converting a general statement about all greedy kings being evil into specific statements about individuals like John or Richard, and giving a name to an entity that satisfies a specific condition without previously specifying what that entity is, as with the concept of the mathematical constant e.\n",
    "- Overall, this section provides a foundation for understanding how first-order logic inferences can be simplified and processed using techniques derived from propositional logic, albeit recognizing the potential complexity and limitations of such transformations.\n"

    "### 9.1.1 Reduction to Propositional Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The section explains how to transform a first-order knowledge base (FOKB) into a propositional knowledge base (PKB), allowing the use of simpler propositional inference techniques on complex first-order logic statements.\n",
    "- **Universally Quantified Sentences:** It starts with the method for handling universally quantified sentences by replacing them with all possible instantiations. For instance, if the knowledge base asserts that all greedy kings are evil and includes information about individuals John and Richard, universal instantiation (UI) is applied to generate specific propositions about John and Richard based on the general rule.\n",
    "- **Existentially Quantified Sentences:** Similarly, existentially quantified sentences can be instantiated with specific constants, turning abstract statements into concrete propositions.\n",
    "- **Propositionalization:** The process includes converting ground atomic sentences into proposition symbols (e.g., \"King(John)\" becomes \"JohnIsKing\") and then applying propositional inference algorithms to derive conclusions (e.g., \"JohnIsEvil\").\n",
    "- **Herbrand's Theorem:** The section acknowledges a major challenge in this reduction process—when function symbols lead to an infinite set of possible instantiations (e.g., \"Father(Father(John))\"). It introduces Herbrand's Theorem, which states that if a sentence is entailed by an FOKB, there is a proof involving only a finite subset of the propositionalized knowledge base, despite the potential for infinite instantiations.\n",
    "- **Completeness and Limitations:** This approach to first-order inference through propositionalization is presented as complete, meaning it can theoretically prove any entailed sentence. However, the method's practicality is limited by the fact that it cannot predict whether a sentence is not entailed. The process might endlessly generate more complex terms without ever concluding that a sentence is not entailed, akin to the halting problem in computation.\n",
    "- **Semidecidability of First-Order Logic:** The section concludes by reflecting on the semidecidability of first-order logic entailment—while algorithms can confirm entailment for any true sentence, no algorithm can definitively reject all non-entailed sentences. This characteristic underlines the inherent complexity and limitations of automated inference in first-order logic, as demonstrated by foundational work by Alan Turing and Alonzo Church."

    "## 9.2 Unification and First-Order Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unification as an Efficient Alternative:** The section introduces unification as a more efficient alternative to the brute-force propositionalization approach for first-order inference. Unification aims to find a specific substitution that can directly apply to the premises of an implication to match sentences already in the knowledge base, thus avoiding the generation of many unnecessary instantiations.\n",
    "- **Generalized Modus Ponens (GMP):** The core of this section is the introduction of Generalized Modus Ponens as a single inference rule that encapsulates the unification process. GMP extends the classical Modus Ponens from propositional to first-order logic by finding substitutions (θ) that make the premises of an implication align with statements in the knowledge base, thus enabling the inference of the conclusion.\n",
    "- **Example of GMP:** An illustrative example demonstrates how GMP works by using a knowledge base that asserts all greedy kings are evil and includes statements about specific individuals. Through the process of unification, GMP can infer that John is evil if John is known to be a king and, due to a universal statement, known to be greedy.\n",
    "- **Soundness of GMP:** The section asserts the soundness of Generalized Modus Ponens by showing that any sentence, when universally quantified, can be instantiated to a specific case through a substitution θ. This instantiation forms the basis of the GMP rule, confirming its logical validity.\n",
    "- **Advantages of Unification:** Unification and GMP offer significant advantages over propositionalization by only making necessary substitutions to facilitate specific inferences. This focused approach avoids the combinatorial explosion of possibilities inherent in attempting to propositionalize an entire first-order knowledge base.\n",
    "- **Lifting Inference Rules:** The concept of \"lifting\" inference rules from propositional to first-order logic is emphasized. GMP is highlighted as a prime example of this lifting, showcasing how classical inference mechanisms can be adapted to handle the more complex structures of first-order logic without resorting to full propositionalization.\n",
    "- **Impact on Inference Algorithms:** The section concludes by suggesting that unification and the principles of GMP can be extended to enhance other inference algorithms (forward chaining, backward chaining, and resolution) introduced earlier in the text, providing a pathway to more efficient and scalable first-order reasoning systems."

    "### 9.2.1 Unification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition and Importance:** Unification is described as a critical process for lifted inference rules, essential for all first-order inference algorithms. It involves finding substitutions that make different logical expressions identical, facilitating the inference process.\n",
    "- **UNIFY Algorithm:** The UNIFY algorithm is introduced as a method to find a unifier (a substitution θ) for two sentences, where applying θ to both sentences makes them identical. This capability is foundational for answering queries within a knowledge base by matching query terms with terms in the knowledge base.\n",
    "- **Examples of Unification:** The text provides examples to illustrate how unification works in practice, showing successful unifications that yield substitutions making terms identical, and highlighting a case of failure due to variable naming conflicts. This underscores the need for careful handling of variable names to avoid clashes and ensure successful unification.\n",
    "- **Standardizing Apart:** To overcome variable naming conflicts, the concept of standardizing apart is introduced. This involves renaming variables in one of the sentences to be unified, thus avoiding name clashes and enabling successful unification even when the original attempt fails due to variable name overlap.\n",
    "- **Most General Unifier (MGU):** The discussion points out that while there may be multiple possible unifiers for a pair of expressions, there exists a single most general unifier (MGU) for any unifiable pair. The MGU is unique up to renaming and substitution of variables, placing the fewest restrictions on variable values, thus making it the preferred choice for unification.\n",
    "- **Algorithm and Complexity:** An algorithm for computing MGUs is briefly mentioned, highlighting its recursive nature and the need for an \"occur check\" to prevent circular references where a variable appears within its own substitution term. The occur check is noted as the most computationally expensive part of the algorithm, making its complexity quadratic in the size of the expressions being unified. Some systems may omit this check to reduce complexity but at the risk of making unsound inferences.\n",
    "- **Implications for Inference Systems:** The section concludes with remarks on the practical implications of unification for logic programming and inference systems. While some systems choose to simplify by omitting the occur check, others employ more sophisticated algorithms to maintain soundness while achieving linear-time complexity."

    "### 9.2.2 Storage and Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Functions:** The section introduces the foundational functions for interacting with a knowledge base: STORE and FETCH. STORE is used to add a sentence to the knowledge base, while FETCH retrieves all sentences that unify with a given query, leveraging the unification process described earlier.\n",
    "- **Efficiency Challenge:** Initially, the simplest approach to implement these functions is by storing all facts in a long list and attempting unification of a query against each element. This brute-force method is recognized as inefficient, prompting a discussion on more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Predicate Indexing:** To improve efficiency, the text suggests predicate indexing, a method where facts are categorized based on their predicate symbol and stored in separate \"buckets.\" This approach reduces the number of unnecessary unification attempts by ensuring that queries are only matched against potentially relevant sentences.\n",
    "- **Indexing Challenges with High Volume Predicates:** The section acknowledges the limitations of simple predicate indexing when dealing with predicates that have a large number of clauses, illustrating with the example of an `Employs` predicate. It suggests enhanced indexing strategies that also consider argument positions, enabling more precise retrieval for queries with specific argument requirements.\n",
    "- **Subsumption Lattice for Indexing:** An advanced concept introduced is the subsumption lattice, which organizes queries based on a hierarchy of specificity. This lattice illustrates how sentences can be indexed to quickly respond to various levels of specific queries, from very detailed to more general.\n",
    "- **Trade-offs in Index Creation:** While creating indices for every possible query that might match a stored sentence could theoretically optimize retrieval, the exponential growth in the number of indices with the number of arguments (and the complexity of the sentences) makes this impractical. The text discusses the necessity of balancing the workload of index creation against the benefits in retrieval time.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Indexing Strategies:** Recognizing the impracticality of exhaustive indexing, the section contemplates strategies to limit indices to those most likely to be utilized frequently, suggesting either fixed policies or adaptive strategies that evolve based on the types of queries commonly posed to the knowledge base.\n",
    "- **Real-world Application and Optimization:** Finally, the discussion highlights the relevance of these indexing and storage challenges to commercial databases, where the scale of data necessitates intensive study, technology development, and continuous optimization to manage billions of facts efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the chapter emphasizes the critical role of efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms in knowledge bases, introducing techniques like predicate indexing and the concept of a subsumption lattice to facilitate quick and relevant access to stored information, all while acknowledging the complexities and trade-offs involved in implementing these systems at scale."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expansion from Propositional to First-Order Logic:** The section discusses the extension of the forward-chaining algorithm, previously introduced for propositional logic in Section 7.5, to handle first-order definite clauses. This expansion allows the algorithm to work within the more complex domain of first-order logic, which can represent and reason about relations among objects and not just boolean variables.\n",
    "- **Limitations and Applicability:** It acknowledges that forward chaining cannot be applied to all types of logical sentences. Specifically, sentences that cannot be expressed as definite clauses (a type of logical construct that has a single conclusion (consequent) and one or more premises (antecedents)) are beyond the scope of this method. Despite these limitations, the text highlights the practical utility of this approach, noting that rules in the form of \"Antecedent ⇒ Consequent\" are broadly applicable and can model a wide range of real-world systems effectively.\n",
    "- **Focus on Definite Clauses:** The emphasis is on utilizing forward chaining for knowledge bases composed of first-order definite clauses. These clauses represent rules or knowledge in a format conducive to the step-by-step application of the forward chaining process, where conclusions can be systematically derived from given premises through the application of these rules.\n",
    "- **Real-World Systems Modeling:** The section suggests that despite its limitations, forward chaining in the context of first-order logic is powerful enough to model complex systems. This is because many systems can be effectively described using rules that fit the \"Antecedent ⇒ Consequent\" structure, making forward chaining a valuable tool for inference in areas such as expert systems, automated reasoning, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the chapter sets the stage for a deeper exploration of how forward chaining is adapted to work with first-order logic, maintaining its utility in automated reasoning while addressing the challenges posed by the richer expressiveness of first-order logic compared to propositional logic.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition and Structure:** First-order definite clauses are defined as disjunctions of literals where exactly one is positive. This can either be a single atomic statement or an implication with a conjunction of positive literals as its antecedent and a single positive literal as its consequent. Universal quantifiers are implied and existential quantifiers are not permitted within these clauses.\n",
    "- **Implicit Universal Quantification:** The presence of a variable within a definite clause implies an implicit universal quantification over that variable. For instance, a clause like `Greedy(y)` is understood as stating that everyone is greedy, due to the implicit `∀y`.\n",
    "- **Example Problem Representation:** The section illustrates how to use first-order definite clauses to model a complex problem involving laws about selling weapons to hostile nations, ownership of missiles by a country named Nono, and the nationality of Colonel West.\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base Construction:** A series of first-order definite clauses is constructed to represent various facts and rules about the scenario:\n",
    "   - **Legal rule:** An American selling weapons to a hostile nation is a criminal.\n",
    "   - **Ownership:** Nono owns some missiles, represented by introducing a constant `M1` for existential instantiation.\n",
    "   - **Sales:** All missiles owned by Nono were sold by Colonel West.\n",

    "- **Algorithm Overview:** The algorithm iteratively applies rules from a set of known facts, triggering any rules whose premises are satisfied and adding their conclusions to the known facts. This process continues until either the query is answered or no new facts can be added, avoiding mere renamings of existing facts as \"new.\"\n",
    "- **Renaming of Facts:** A fact is not considered \"new\" if it only differs in the names of its variables from an already known fact, emphasizing the algorithm's disregard for variable naming in determining the novelty of information.\n",
    "- **Illustration with a Crime Problem:** The application of the algorithm is demonstrated using a problem scenario involving crimes related to selling weapons to hostile nations. The example walks through the iterative process, showing how different rules lead to the conclusion that a character, Colonel West, is a criminal based on the given knowledge base.\n",
    "- **Fixed Point:** The knowledge base reaches a fixed point when no new inferences can be made, meaning every sentence that could be concluded is already present. This fixed point can include universally quantified sentences, a feature specific to first-order logic compared to propositional logic.\n",
    "- **Soundness and Completeness:** The algorithm is sound because each inference is an application of Generalized Modus Ponens. It is complete for definite clause knowledge bases, capable of answering any query whose answer is entailed by the knowledge base.\n",
    "- **Datalog Knowledge Bases:** For Datalog knowledge bases (without function symbols), the proof of completeness is straightforward, involving a count of possible facts based on predicates and constants, leading to a maximum number of iterations before reaching a fixed point.\n",
    "- **General Definite Clauses and Complexity:** The situation becomes more complex with general definite clauses that include function symbols, as infinitely many new facts can be generated. The algorithm's ability to find a proof in such cases relies on Herbrand's theorem, but it may fail to terminate if the query has no answer, illustrating the semidecidable nature of entailment with definite clauses.\n",

    "- **Inefficiencies in Basic Algorithm:** The basic forward-chaining algorithm prioritizes simplicity over efficiency, leading to several inefficiencies:\n",
    "   - **Exhaustive Matching:** The algorithm attempts to match each rule against every fact in the knowledge base, regardless of relevance or likelihood of a match.\n",
    "   - **Redundant Rechecks:** It re-evaluates all rules during each iteration, even if the knowledge base has seen only a few or no new facts added.\n",

    "## 9.3. Matching Rules Against Known Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Matching Process:** Matching the premise of a rule against facts in the knowledge base seems straightforward. For example, applying a rule like `Missile(x) ⇒ Weapon(x)` involves finding all facts that unify with `Missile(x)`. With a well-indexed knowledge base, this task can be executed efficiently.\n",
    "- **Conjunct Ordering Problem:** When dealing with rules that have multiple premises, such as `Missile(x)∧Owns(Nono,x) ⇒ Sells(West,x,Nono)`, determining the most efficient order to evaluate the premises becomes crucial. The goal is to minimize the total cost of matching, which can vary significantly based on the distribution of facts within the knowledge base. Finding the optimal order is NP-hard, but heuristics like the minimum-remaining-values (MRV) can provide effective strategies.\n",
    "- **Pattern Matching as Constraint Satisfaction:** The process of matching conjuncts to facts can be viewed similarly to solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), where each conjunct represents a constraint on the variables it contains. This perspective allows for the application of CSP solutions to improve the efficiency of rule matching.\n",
    "- **NP-Hardness of Matching:** The NP-hard nature of matching a definite clause against a set of facts underscores the computational complexity of forward chaining. This complexity arises because the process can be equivalent to solving 3-SAT problems, a known NP-hard challenge.\n",
    "- **Mitigating NP-Hardness:** Despite the inherent NP-hardness of the matching process, there are several strategies to mitigate its impact:\n",
    "   - **Real-world Simplifications:** In practice, most rules in knowledge bases are relatively simple, and both the size of rules and the arity of predicates tend to be limited. This confines the computational complexity to polynomial levels when considering the data complexity, or the complexity as a function of the number of ground facts.\n",
    "   - **Efficient Subclasses of Rules:** By identifying subclasses of rules for which matching is efficient—akin to tractable families of CSPs—rule matching can be made more manageable. For instance, rules that correspond to tree-structured CSPs can be matched efficiently using algorithms designed for linear-time CSP solving.\n",
    "   - **Eliminating Redundant Matches:** Improving the forward-chaining algorithm to avoid unnecessary rule-matching attempts can significantly enhance efficiency. This involves identifying and skipping matches that are unlikely to contribute new information to the knowledge base."

It observes that any fact inferred in iteration *t* must involve at least one fact newly inferred in iteration *t-1*, eliminating redundant rule matching by not rechecking rules that cannot be triggered by newly added facts.\n",
    "- **Implementation:** The algorithm only considers a rule if its premise contains a conjunct that matches a fact added in the last iteration. This targeted approach ensures that only potentially relevant rules are evaluated, significantly reducing the computational overhead compared to checking every rule against all facts on each iteration.\n",

This \"update\" mode allows for efficient cascading of inferences until no further facts can be added, streamlining the process of reaching a fixed point.\n",
    "- **Reducing Redundant Work:** Traditional forward-chaining can involve a lot of redundant effort in constructing and discarding partial matches of rule premises to facts. Incremental forward chaining, by contrast, aims to maintain and gradually complete these partial matches as new facts are introduced, avoiding unnecessary recomputation.\n",

In these models, the dynamic interaction between working memory (analogous to human short-term memory) and productions (part of long-term memory) facilitates reasoning processes, demonstrating the versatility of forward-chaining mechanisms in simulating complex cognitive functions.\n",

This can result in computational waste, as seen in hypothetical expansions of the crime example where irrelevant details about Americans' eating habits or missile components could be inferred.\n",
    "- **Backward Chaining as a Solution:** One solution to prevent the inference of irrelevant facts is backward chaining, which starts from the goal and works backward, only considering facts and rules directly related to achieving the goal. This ensures relevance but may not always be applicable or efficient for all types of knowledge bases.\n",

This could involve selecting a subset of rules likely to lead to the goal, akin to strategies employed in propositional logic inference systems, ensuring that the process remains focused on relevant inferences.\n",
    "- **Deductive Databases and Magic Sets:** In deductive databases, which use forward chaining over SQL queries for inference, the concept of \"magic sets\" is used to rewrite rule sets based on the goal. This method involves adding a condition to rules that ensure only variable bindings relevant to achieving the goal are considered during inference. For instance, if looking to prove `Criminal(West)`, rules related to criminality are constrained to focus on `West`, significantly narrowing the scope of inference to relevant facts only.\n",

By identifying and constraining variable bindings related to the goal before executing forward chaining, the system efficiently focuses on pertinent inferences, combining the breadth of forward chaining with the goal-directed nature of backward chaining.\n",

    "### 9.4.1 A Backward-Chaining Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Principle:** The backward-chaining algorithm operates by working backward from the goal to find supporting facts or rules in the knowledge base (KB). It seeks rules of the form `lhs ⇒ goal`, where `lhs` (left-hand side) consists of one or more conjuncts that need to be satisfied to prove the goal.\n",
    "- **Handling Atomic Facts:** Atomic facts, such as `American(West)`, are treated as clauses with an empty `lhs`, implying they are directly true without needing further proof.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions for Queries with Variables:** When a query involves variables, the algorithm is capable of generating multiple proofs, each with a different substitution for the variables. This is implemented through a generator function that yields one possible solution at a time.\n",
    "- **AND/OR Search Structure:** The algorithm embodies an AND/OR search logic:\n",
    "   - **OR:** A goal can be satisfied by any applicable rule within the KB, reflecting the OR part of the search.\n",
    "   - **AND:** All conjuncts in the `lhs` of a chosen rule must be satisfied to prove the goal, representing the AND part of the search.\n",

    "### **Operational Flow:** `FOL-BC-OR` fetches all clauses that could unify with the goal and standardizes their variables.

This approach is encapsulated in Robert Kowalski's equation \"Algorithm = Logic + Control,\" highlighting the blend of logical declarations with control mechanisms for problem-solving.\n",
    "- **Prolog:** The most prominent example of a logic programming language is Prolog, known for its use in rapid prototyping and tasks requiring symbol manipulation, such as compiler construction and natural language parsing. It's also widely used in developing expert systems across various domains, including legal, medical, and financial sectors.\n",
    "- **Syntax and Semantics:** Prolog's syntax differs from standard first-order logic notation, using uppercase for variables and lowercase for constants. Clauses are written in a reversed format compared to the usual logical expressions, with Prolog employing a notation like `C :- A, B` for clauses that would be represented as `A ∧ B ⇒ C` in standard logic.\n",
    "- **Powerful Relations:** Prolog excels in defining relations rather than functions, allowing for versatile queries that can solve for multiple variables simultaneously. This capability is demonstrated in Prolog's approach to list manipulation and other operations that can be described more powerfully as relations than as functions.\n",
    "- **Execution and Efficiency:** Prolog programs execute through depth-first backward chaining, trying clauses in the order they appear in the knowledge base. This method strikes a balance between declarative clarity and execution efficiency, though it comes with some departures from standard logical inference practices:\n",
    "   - **Database Semantics:** Prolog adopts database semantics for certain operations, affecting its treatment of equality and negation.\n",
    "   - **Built-in Functions:** It includes built-in functions for arithmetic and other operations, which are executed directly rather than inferred logically.\n",
    "   - **Side Effects:** Prolog allows predicates that produce side effects, such as input/output operations and knowledge base modifications, which do not have direct analogs in pure logic.\n",

This issue becomes evident when searching for paths in a directed graph. Depending on the order of clauses, Prolog may either successfully find a path or enter an infinite loop, demonstrating its incompleteness as a theorem prover for definite clauses.\n",
    "- **Redundant Computations:** Depth-first backward chaining can lead to a significant amount of redundant computations. An example is provided where searching for a path in a graph leads Prolog to perform an excessive number of inferences, many of which are redundant because they involve exploring paths leading to nodes from which the goal is unreachable.\n",
    "- **Comparison with Forward Chaining:** Unlike backward chaining, forward chaining does not encounter the issue of infinite loops in the same context. It halts once all possible paths have been inferred, showcasing an advantage in scenarios involving graph search problems. Forward chaining aligns with the principles of dynamic programming, where solutions are built incrementally and cached to prevent redundant work.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming in Backward Chaining:** A backward chaining system can similarly benefit from dynamic programming techniques by breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable ones and caching intermediate results. This strategy helps mitigate the issues of redundancy and inefficiency associated with pure depth-first search.\n",
    "- **Tabled Logic Programming:** Tabled logic programming systems address these challenges by efficiently storing and retrieving intermediate results, blending the goal-directed approach of backward chaining with the efficiency of forward chaining. This combination ensures completeness for Datalog knowledge bases and reduces concerns about infinite loops, although challenges remain with predicates that imply a potentially unbounded domain.\n",

These assumptions contribute to Prolog's efficiency and conciseness, differentiating its operational semantics from those of first-order logic (FOL).\n",
    "- **Unique Names Assumption:** This principle posits that each constant and ground term in Prolog refers to a distinct entity. For instance, different course codes and numbers in course offerings are presumed to represent unique courses, eliminating ambiguity regarding entity identity.\n",
    "- **Closed-World Assumption:** According to this assumption, any statement not explicitly provable by the knowledge base is considered false. This negates the need to assert falsity explicitly, simplifying the representation of knowledge by assuming that unmentioned entities or facts do not exist within the domain of discourse.\n",
    "- **Expressiveness vs. Efficiency:** While these assumptions make Prolog less expressive than FOL — unable to represent the nuances of potentially infinite entities or the non-uniqueness of entities without explicit negation — they enhance its efficiency and make Prolog programs more concise and straightforward to reason about.\n",
    "- **Example of Course Offerings:** The course offering example illustrates how the unique names and closed-world assumptions allow for a clear representation of distinct courses and the assumption that no other courses exist beyond those specified. This contrasts with FOL, where additional assertions are necessary to exclude the existence of other courses or to affirm the distinctiveness of each course.\n",
    "- **Completion in FOL:** To accurately represent the semantics of Prolog statements in FOL, a process called \"completion\" is used. This involves explicitly defining what exists (and therefore what does not) based on the provided statements, as well as detailing equality conditions among entities. Completion captures the full implications of database semantics within the more expressive, but less efficient, framework of FOL.\n",
    "- **Practical Implications:** For problems that fit within database semantics, it is more practical to use Prolog or similar systems rather than translating the problem into FOL and employing a general FOL theorem prover. This approach leverages the efficiency of database semantics in Prolog, making it well-suited for a wide range of logical reasoning tasks.\n",

They can employ more efficient algorithms than depth-first, left-to-right backtracking, such as heuristic conjunct ordering and backjumping, enhancing both the power and efficiency of logic programming.\n",

After converting the involved sentences into CNF — a process that includes Skolemization to handle existential quantifiers — resolution is used to deduce that Curiosity did indeed kill Tuna. This proof demonstrates resolution's capability to handle complex logical constructs and derive conclusions from a mix of definite and indefinite clauses.\n",

        "- **Classical planning**  is the task of finding a sequence of actions to achieve a goal within a discrete, deterministic, static, fully observable environment. This form of planning contrasts with non-classical domains that may involve uncertainty, dynamic changes, or partial observability.\n",
        "- Previous approaches, including the **problem-solving agent**  and the **hybrid propositional logical agent** , faced limitations due to the need for domain-specific heuristics and the challenge of representing exponentially large state spaces.\n",
        "- The **Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)**  was introduced to address these limitations, providing a factored representation that simplifies the expression of actions and states across various domains without requiring domain-specific knowledge. PDDL supports classical planning domains and has been extended to accommodate non-classical domains.\n",

        "- A **state**  in PDDL is described as a conjunction of ground atomic fluents, representing aspects of the world that can change over time. The language adopts database semantics, including the closed-world assumption (unmentioned fluents are false) and the unique names assumption (distinct entities are assumed to be different).\n",
        "- **Action schemas**  in PDDL represent families of ground actions with specified preconditions and effects, allowing for the concise definition of actions that can be applied across different instances within a domain. These schemas enable the planning system to generate sequences of actions (plans) to achieve specific goals.\n",
        "- The execution of an action in a state results in a new state, defined by adding and removing fluents according to the action's effects. This mechanism allows for the dynamic modeling of the world's state as actions are applied.\n",

        "\n",
        "The exploration of algorithms for classical planning delves into the strategies for navigating through the space of states from an initial state to a goal state. This process is fundamental to solving planning problems by identifying a sequence of actions that leads to the desired outcome. The section outlines three primary approaches to solving classical planning problems:\n",
        "1. **Forward Search:**  This method involves starting from the initial state and progressively applying action schemas to move through the state space towards the goal state. The advantage of this approach lies in its intuitive application of actions, mirroring the real-world process of taking steps toward achieving a goal.\n",
        "2. **Backward Search:**  In contrast to forward search, backward search begins with the goal state and works in reverse to find actions that could lead to the goal from the initial state. This method can be more efficient in certain scenarios, particularly when the goal state is more clearly defined than the path to reach it.\n",
        "3. **Translation to Logic Sentences and Logical Inference:**  This approach converts the planning problem into a set of logic sentences, then uses logical inference algorithms to deduce a sequence of actions that constitute a solution. This method leverages the declarative nature of action schemas and the power of logical reasoning to solve planning problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these algorithms has its advantages and applicability, depending on the specific characteristics of the planning problem, such as the complexity of the state space and the clarity of the goal state. By providing multiple avenues for solving classical planning problems, these algorithms underscore the flexibility and depth of planning techniques in artificial intelligence."

        "\n",
        "Forward state-space search is a method for solving planning problems by traversing the space of possible states from an initial state towards a goal state. This approach utilizes heuristic search algorithms, as discussed in earlier chapters, to efficiently navigate through the complexities of planning environments. The process involves several key components and considerations:\n",
        "- **States:**  The search operates on ground states, where every fluent (a condition that can be true or false in the world) is explicitly true or false. The goal state is defined by a specific combination of fluents that match the goal criteria of the planning problem, including all required positive fluents and the absence of any specified negative fluents.\n",
        "- **Actions:**  Actions are determined based on their applicability in the current state. This involves grounding the action schemas—replacing their variables with constants based on the current state—to generate specific actions (ground actions) that can be executed. The process of unification is used to match the current state with the preconditions of action schemas, resulting in a set of applicable actions.\n",
        "- **Challenges:**  One of the primary challenges of forward state-space search is the potential enormity of the state space, especially in complex problems with many objects and possible actions. The example given of an air cargo problem illustrates how quickly the number of potential actions and subsequent states can grow, leading to a vast search space that is impractical to explore without effective heuristics.\n",
        "- **Heuristics:**  The key to making forward state-space search feasible in large and complex planning problems lies in the use of heuristics. While domain-specific heuristics have been employed in real-world applications, the development of strong domain-independent heuristics has been crucial. These heuristics are derived automatically and can significantly reduce the search space by guiding the search process towards the goal more efficiently.\n",

        "\n",
        "Backward search, also known as regression search, is a method for solving planning problems by starting from the goal state and working backwards to find a sequence of actions that connects to the initial state. This approach focuses on identifying relevant actions at each step, which can significantly reduce the branching factor compared to forward search, especially in domains with a vast number of possible actions. The key concepts and mechanisms of backward search include:\n",
        "- **Relevant Actions:**  An action is considered relevant if its effects include at least one of the goal's literals without negating any part of the goal. This selection criterion ensures that only actions contributing directly towards achieving the goal are considered, streamlining the search process.\n",
        "- **Application of Actions in Reverse:**  To apply an action backward, the process involves regressing the current goal over the action to generate a new goal state (g'). This regression incorporates the action's preconditions while removing and adding literals based on the action's effects, effectively reversing the action's impact to deduce the necessary previous state.\n",
        "- **Handling Variables:**  The regression process must account for variables in actions and goals, often requiring substitutions to align the action's effects with the goal's literals. This can introduce new variables and conditions into the goal state, reflecting the requirements that must have been met for the action to occur.\n",
        "- **Efficiency and Challenges:**  Backward search can be more efficient in domains with many actions by reducing the branching factor. However, the presence of variables in regressed states complicates the development of effective heuristics, making it challenging to guide the search efficiently. This complexity is a primary reason why many systems prefer forward search despite the potential efficiency gains of backward search.\n",
        "- **Examples:**  The summary provides examples demonstrating how backward search can simplify the search process in scenarios with potentially vast action spaces, such as delivering cargo or purchasing a book with a specific ISBN. By focusing on actions relevant to the goal and efficiently regressing over these actions, backward search can quickly narrow down the solution space.\n",

        "In summary, backward search offers a powerful tool for planning by efficiently navigating the space of possible actions in reverse, from the goal back to the initial state. While it presents advantages in reducing the branching factor, the challenges in generating effective heuristics due to variable handling often make forward search a more practical choice for many planning systems."

Instead of a generic action schema, this results in specific action propositions for each possible combination of entities (e.g., cargo, plane, and airport) and for each time step.\n",
        "- **Action Exclusion Axioms:**  These axioms enforce that no two actions can occur simultaneously, ensuring that the plan's actions do not conflict with each other.\n",

        "- **Initial State Definition:**  The initial state of the problem is explicitly defined by asserting which fluents are true and which are not at the beginning of the planning scenario.\n",
        "- **Propositionalization of the Goal:**  The goal state is translated into a propositional form, where it is represented as a disjunction of all possible ground instances that satisfy the goal conditions, with variables replaced by constants.\n",
        "- **Successor-State Axioms:**  For each fluent, an axiom is formulated to define its value at time t+1t+1t+1 based on the actions that cause it to be true or false. This involves specifying which actions add or delete the fluent, ensuring the logical progression of the world state across time steps.\n",

However, the efficiency of modern SAT solvers often compensates for the increased complexity, making SAT-based planning a powerful and effective approach for solving complex planning problems.

However, its practical impact has been limited, partly due to the less developed state of first-order logic provers compared to propositional satisfiability solvers.\n",
        "- **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP):**  Planning can be framed as a CSP, particularly for bounded planning problems where the objective is to find a plan of a specific length. This approach simplifies the encoding compared to SAT-based planning by using a single variable per time step to represent the possible actions, eliminating the need for action exclusion axioms.\n",
        "- **Partial-Order Planning:**  Unlike methods that generate strictly linear sequences of actions, partial-order planning represents plans as graphs, allowing for more flexible action ordering. This approach is adept at managing independent subproblems within a larger planning task. Though it was once seen as superior for certain types of planning problems, advancements in forward-search planners and the capabilities of SATPLAN, combined with the exponential growth in computing power, have lessened its competitiveness in fully automated classical planning domains.\n",

For instance, planning for spacecraft and Mars rovers often employs partial-order planning to facilitate human oversight before plan execution. This adaptability underscores the diversity and richness of planning methods within artificial intelligence, highlighting the continuous evolution of strategies to tackle complex planning problems effectively."

        "\n",
        "Effective heuristics are crucial for enhancing the efficiency of both forward and backward search in planning. A heuristic function h(s)h(s)h(s) estimates the cost or steps required to reach the goal from a given state sss, aiming for admissibility by not overestimating this distance. This section discusses domain-independent heuristics developed from the factored representation of states and actions in planning, contrasting with the atomic state analysis that typically requires domain-specific heuristics.\n",
        "### Key Points\n",
        "- **Admissible Heuristics:**  These are derived from simplifying the original problem into a \"relaxed\" problem that is easier to solve. The solution cost to the relaxed problem serves as the heuristic estimate for the original problem.\n",
        "- **Relaxation Strategies:**  Simplifying the problem can involve adding more actions (edges in the graph) or abstracting the state space to reduce the number of states. Two primary heuristic strategies discussed are:\n",
        "- **Ignore Preconditions Heuristic:**  Removes all preconditions from actions, making every action available in every state. This simplification implies that achieving each goal fluent might take one step, although complications arise due to actions that might achieve multiple goals or undo others' effects.\n",
        "- **Ignore Delete-Lists Heuristic:**  By removing the delete effects of actions (negative literals), this heuristic prevents actions from undoing each other's progress, creating a monotonic approach toward the goal. Despite the NP-hard nature of finding an optimal solution in this relaxed setting, approximate solutions can be effectively found through simpler methods like hill climbing.\n",
        "### Applications and Implications\n",
        "- **Automatic Derivation of Heuristics:**  The factored representation allows for the automatic derivation of heuristics, such as the number-of-misplaced-tiles or the Manhattan distance heuristic in sliding-tile puzzles, by selectively ignoring certain preconditions.\n",
        "- **Efficiency in Planning:**  These domain-independent heuristics facilitate the planning process across various domains by enabling heuristic search algorithms like A* to find optimal or near-optimal solutions more efficiently.\n",
        "- **Graphical Representation:**  The heuristic values can be visually represented in state space diagrams, illustrating the heuristic's guidance towards the goal without backtracking, particularly evident in the ignore-delete-lists heuristic's simplification.\n",

        "\n",
        "Domain-independent pruning techniques exploit the structured nature of factored representations in planning problems to significantly enhance search efficiency by eliminating redundant or less promising paths. This approach leverages the understanding that many states in the search space may be equivalent or symmetrical, leading to unnecessary computational overhead if each is considered separately.\n",
        "#### Key Strategies for Pruning\n",
        "- **Symmetry Reduction:**  This technique identifies states that are essentially variations of each other, where the choice among them does not impact the achievement of the goal. By recognizing and eliminating these symmetrical states from consideration—retaining just one representative—the search space becomes more manageable, facilitating more efficient problem-solving.\n",
        "- **Forward Pruning:**  Accepting the risk of potentially overlooking an optimal solution, forward pruning aims to concentrate the search effort on the most promising branches. This is achieved by defining \"preferred actions,\" either as steps in a relaxed plan or actions that fulfill some precondition of the relaxed plan, thus guiding the search towards more likely successful outcomes.\n",
        "#### Applications and Benefits\n",
        "- **Efficient Solution Discovery:**  By reducing the search space, these pruning techniques make it feasible to solve problems that would otherwise be intractable due to the sheer number of states or actions to consider.\n",
        "- **Serializable Subgoals:**  Identifying that a problem's subgoals can be achieved in a specific sequence without negating prior achievements allows for a streamlined planning approach. For instance, constructing a tower from the bottom up in the blocks world or activating light switches in a fixed order exemplifies how recognizing serializable subgoals can eliminate the need for backtracking and reduce complexity.\n",
        "#### Practical Implications\n",
        "- **Real-World Applications:**  The Remote Agent planner, used to control NASA’s [Deep Space One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_1) spacecraft, demonstrated the practical significance of these techniques. By identifying that the spacecraft's control propositions were serializable, the planner could efficiently manage the spacecraft in real time, a task previously deemed unfeasible due to computational constraints.\n",

        "\n",
        "State abstraction in planning aims to simplify complex planning problems by reducing the number of states to be considered. This simplification is achieved through a process of abstraction, where details irrelevant to achieving the goal are omitted, resulting in a many-to-one mapping from the detailed ground states to more abstract representations.\n",

This can significantly lower the complexity from potentially infeasible levels to manageable ones.\n",
        "- **Fluent Ignoring:**  By selectively ignoring some fluents—details about the state that can change over time—the size of the state space can be dramatically reduced. For instance, in an air cargo problem, focusing only on crucial At fluents related to specific planes and packages can reduce the state space from an overwhelming number to a tractable one.\n",
        "- **Decomposition and Subgoal Independence:**  Decomposing a problem into independent subgoals and solving each separately can simplify planning. The cost of solving the entire problem can be approximated by combining the costs of solving its parts, assuming subgoal independence. This assumption can be optimistic or pessimistic, affecting the admissibility of the heuristic derived from the decomposition.\n",
        "#### Applications and Implications\n",
        "- **Admissibility and Heuristic Estimation:**  Solutions found within an abstracted state space are inherently shorter and thus admissible as heuristics for the original problem. The challenge lies in optimally combining solutions to subgoals, where summing individual costs can offer a reasonable estimate but may not always be admissible.\n",
        "- **Pattern Databases:**  Utilizing pattern databases, which precompute and store the costs of achieving subgoals, can further enhance efficiency. The initial cost of creating these databases is offset by their utility across multiple problem instances.\n",
        "- **FF Planner:**  An example of a system leveraging effective heuristics, FF (FASTFORWARD) uses state abstraction and the ignore-delete-lists heuristic to estimate costs within a planning graph framework. FF employs a modified hill climbing search, supplemented by breadth-first and greedy best-first searches to navigate around local maxima.\n",

        "State abstraction represents a powerful strategy for managing the complexity of planning problems by focusing on the essential elements necessary for goal achievement. Through careful selection of fluents to ignore and strategic decomposition of goals into independent subgoals, planners can effectively reduce the search space, making it possible to solve otherwise intractable problems. Tools like FF demonstrate the practical application of these concepts, showcasing the potential of state abstraction combined with innovative search techniques to find solutions efficiently in the vast landscape of planning challenges."

This methodology mirrors the organizational structures found in software development, military operations, and corporate management, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in various domains. By enabling planners to tackle problems at different levels of abstraction and detail, hierarchical planning facilitates the efficient organization and execution of tasks that would otherwise be overwhelming due to their complexity."

        "\n",
        "Sensorless planning, also known as conformant planning, addresses the challenge of operating in environments where agents cannot make observations to inform their decisions. This approach relies on belief-state planning, where actions are designed to ensure goal achievement under uncertainty.\n",
        "#### Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Belief States:**  Represent sets of possible worlds that satisfy certain logical conditions, allowing agents to plan actions without direct observations. These are represented by logical formulas rather than explicit state enumeration.\n",
        "- **Action Schemas:**  Define the transition model in terms of actions that can be applied in a belief state, considering deterministic outcomes to update the belief state based on the action's effects.\n",
        "- **Updating Belief States:**  The process involves determining the applicability of actions in a given belief state and updating the state to reflect the actions' effects, focusing on maintaining a logical representation of possible worlds.\n",
        "#### Planning Process\n",
        "- **Initial Belief State:**  Defined by logical formulas that capture the agent's knowledge and assumptions about the environment, excluding specific details unknown to the agent.\n",
        "- **Action Sequence Solution:**  A sequence of actions that transforms the initial belief state into one that satisfies the goal conditions, demonstrated through logical progression and satisfaction of goal predicates.\n",
        "- **Belief State Progression:**  The belief state is updated through actions, maintaining a representation that encompasses all potential outcomes of these actions, ultimately leading to a state that meets the goal criteria.\n",
        "#### Challenges and Solutions\n",
        "- **Conditional Effects:**  Actions with effects that depend on the current state introduce complexity, requiring conditional effect schemas to accurately model the outcomes of actions.\n",
        "- **Representation Complexity:**  While sensorless planning aims to keep belief states manageable (e.g., in 1-CNF form), actions with conditional effects can lead to more complex, potentially exponential belief state representations.\n",
        "- **Heuristic Functions:**  Essential for guiding the search process, heuristic functions estimate the cost of achieving the goal from a given belief state. Admissible heuristics can be derived from subsets of the belief state, providing a basis for planning decisions.\n",
        "#### Practical Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "Sensorless planning is crucial for devising robust plans in environments where direct observation is not possible, leveraging logical reasoning to navigate uncertainty. The approach enables agents to plan effectively, even when faced with incomplete information, by systematically updating their belief about the world based on the actions taken. This method highlights the importance of logical representations and heuristics in managing the complexity of planning without sensory feedback, offering a foundation for making informed decisions in uncertain contexts.\n"

        "\n",
        "Contingent planning addresses challenges in environments characterized by partial observability and nondeterminism by generating plans that incorporate conditional branching based on observed percepts. This approach enables the creation of flexible plans that can adapt to various outcomes as information becomes available.\n",
        "#### Key Components\n",
        "- **Conditional Plans:**  Contingent plans are structured to include if-else conditions that depend on the percepts received during execution. These conditions allow the plan to adapt based on the current state and available information, ensuring that actions are only taken when their preconditions are met.\n",
        "- **Belief State Management:**  A contingent-planning agent maintains its belief state as a logical formula, updating this state based on actions taken and percepts observed. The belief state represents the agent's current understanding of the world, which informs decision-making as the plan unfolds.\n",
        "- **Evaluating Branch Conditions:**  The agent evaluates each branch condition by checking if the current belief state entails the condition or its negation. This ensures that the agent can always decide on the next step, assuming the planning algorithm prevents the agent from encountering unknown conditions.\n",
        "#### Process of Updating Belief States\n",
        "- **Action Effects:**  The belief state is first updated based on the action's effects, similar to sensorless planning. This update considers both the addition and deletion of literals according to the action's specifications.\n",
        "- **Percept Handling:**  When percepts are received, they not only update the belief state directly but also imply that the preconditions for sensing those percepts are satisfied. This can lead to the addition of both the percept literals and the inferred preconditions into the belief state, potentially complicating its logical structure.\n",
        "#### Challenges and Solutions\n",
        "- **Complexity of Belief States:**  The introduction of disjunctions from multiple percept schemas or conditional effects can take the belief state outside of a simple conjunctive form (1-CNF), increasing the complexity of managing and updating this state.\n",
        "- **Search Algorithm:**  Contingent plans are generated through an extension of AND–OR forward search over belief states, accommodating actions with nondeterministic effects by adjusting the belief-state update calculation.\n",
        "#### Heuristic Functions\n",
        "- **Applicability:**  Many heuristic methods applicable to sensorless planning can also be employed in contingent planning, helping to estimate the cost of achieving the goal from a given belief state. These heuristics support the search process by guiding it towards more promising branches of the plan.\n",
        "#### Practical Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "Contingent planning is essential for dealing with real-world scenarios where uncertainty and partial information play significant roles. By preparing for different eventualities through conditional branching and maintaining a dynamic belief state, agents can navigate complex environments with greater efficacy. This planning approach underscores the importance of flexibility and adaptability in decision-making processes, especially when facing unpredictable or incompletely understood situations."

        "\n",
        "Online planning addresses the need for flexibility and adaptability in dynamic, uncertain environments by integrating planning, execution, and replanning processes. This approach is crucial for dealing with unexpected events, incorrect world models, or incomplete plans, ensuring that agents can pursue their goals effectively even as conditions change.\n",
        "#### Key Features\n",
        "- **Execution Monitoring:**  Online planning requires mechanisms for execution monitoring, enabling the agent to detect when deviations from the expected state occur, necessitating replanning.\n",
        "- **Replanning:**  When the current plan is no longer viable—due to unexpected outcomes, unmet preconditions, or changes in the environment—the agent generates a new plan based on the current state and knowledge.\n",
        "- **Monitoring Strategies:**  Agents can employ various monitoring strategies, including action monitoring (verifying preconditions before action execution), plan monitoring (ensuring the remaining plan is still viable), and goal monitoring (assessing if current goals remain optimal).\n",
        "#### Challenges and Approaches\n",
        "- **Incomplete Contingent Plans:**  Agents may leave contingent plans incomplete, marking certain branches for replanning if encountered. This allows for a balance between detailed upfront planning and the flexibility to adapt to unforeseen situations.\n",
        "- **Model Inaccuracy:**  Online planning is particularly valuable when the agent's model of the world is incomplete or incorrect, allowing for adjustments to plans based on new information or corrected understanding.\n",
        "- **Handling Exogenous Events:**  Agents must be capable of adapting to external changes not accounted for in the initial plan, including unexpected goal alterations.\n",
        "#### Practical Implications\n",
        "- **Adaptive Behavior:**  Online planning enables agents to display intelligent, purpose-driven behavior, adjusting their actions in response to real-time feedback and changes in their environment.\n",
        "- **Efficient Resource Use:**  By focusing on current conditions and available information, agents can make more efficient use of resources, avoiding wasteful actions based on outdated or incorrect assumptions.\n",
        "- **Learning from Failure:**  Each failure or unexpected outcome presents an opportunity for learning, allowing agents to refine their models and strategies for future planning.\n",
        "#### Conclusion\n",

        "Online planning is a sophisticated approach that blends planning, execution, and continuous adaptation to navigate complex, changing environments successfully. It empowers agents to act intelligently, addressing immediate challenges while remaining aligned with broader goals. This dynamic process of planning and replanning not only enhances the agent's effectiveness in achieving objectives but also contributes to the development of more accurate and comprehensive models of the world."

        "In real-world applications, classical planning's scope—determining the sequence of actions—needs to be expanded to address the temporal and resource constraints inherent in many tasks. This necessity gives rise to the domain of planning and scheduling, which incorporates considerations of time, schedules, and the availability of resources into the planning process.\n",
        "### Key Aspects\n",
        "- **Temporal Planning:**  Extends classical planning by incorporating the duration of actions, allowing for the specification of when actions occur and how long they take. This is crucial for creating realistic plans that align with time-bound objectives.\n",
        "- **Resource Constraints:**  Real-world planning often involves limited resources, such as personnel, equipment, or materials. Effective planning must account for these limitations, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and do not exceed availability.\n",
        "- **Plan First, Schedule Later:**  A common approach to addressing these complexities is to separate the process into two phases:\n",
        "- **Planning Phase:**  Focuses on selecting the necessary actions and establishing a general order to achieve the goals, without detailed consideration of timing or resource allocation.\n",
        "- **Scheduling Phase:**  Adds temporal information and allocates resources to the pre-determined plan, ensuring that time constraints are met and resources are not over-committed.\n",
        "### Application and Implementation\n",
        "- **Real-World Settings:**  This dual-phase approach is widely used in industries such as manufacturing and logistics, where it's essential to optimize the use of limited resources and adhere to strict timelines.\n",
        "- **Automation and Expertise:**  While some aspects of the planning phase can be automated, leveraging algorithms and artificial intelligence, human experts often play a crucial role in refining these plans and making decisions based on experience and insight.\n",
        "### Challenges and Solutions\n",
        "- **Integration of Planning and Scheduling:**  Effectively combining these two phases can be challenging, as it requires a comprehensive understanding of the tasks' dynamics, resource limitations, and temporal constraints. Solutions often involve sophisticated algorithms that can adapt to the complexity and variability of real-world conditions.\n",
        "- **Adapting to Changes:**  Flexibility is key, as real-world conditions can change rapidly. Plans and schedules may need to be adjusted in response to unforeseen events or shifts in resource availability, requiring systems that can rapidly re-evaluate and modify existing plans.\n",

        "### Parsing and Representation:\n",
        "- **CustomPddlParser**: A custom parser was developed to extract `domain_data` (name, types, predicates, actions) and `problem_data` (name, domain reference, objects, initial state, goal state) from the PDDL files using regular expressions. This was necessary due to issues with external PDDL parsing libraries.\n",
        "- **State Class**: Represents the world state as a `frozenset` of facts, ensuring immutability and hashability for efficient storage in `visited` sets. It includes a `satisfies` method to check if a set of literals (preconditions or goals) is true.\n",
        "- **Action Class**: Encapsulates an action's name, parameters, preconditions, and effects. It provides `check_preconditions` to verify if an action can be applied in a given state and an `apply` method to calculate the resulting state after execution.\n",

        "    2. Using a `deque` as a queue for states to visit and the plans to reach them.\n",
        "    3. Maintaining a `visited` set to avoid revisiting states and preventing infinite loops.\n",
        "    4. Iteratively dequeuing a `(current_state, current_plan)` pair.\n",

        "*   **Ground Action Generation:** A `create_ground_actions` function successfully generated 24 concrete ground actions by systematically combining domain actions with problem objects based on their types, handling parameter substitution for preconditions and effects. For example, `load-c1-p1-sfo` is a grounded instance of the abstract `load` action.\n",
        "*   **BFS Planning Algorithm Implementation:** A Breadth-First Search (`bfs_planner`) algorithm was successfully implemented. It uses a `deque` for managing the search queue and a `visited` set to prevent redundant state exploration, effectively navigating the state space.\n",
        "*   **Solution Plan Found:** For the problem of moving cargo `c1` from 'sfo' to 'jfk', the BFS planner identified a plan consisting of 3 actions:\n",
        "    1.  `load-c1-p1-sfo`: Load cargo `c1` into plane `p1` at airport `sfo`.\n",
        "    2.  `fly-p1-sfo-jfk`: Fly plane `p1` from `sfo` to `jfk`.\n",
        "    3.  `unload-c1-p1-jfk`: Unload cargo `c1` from plane `p1` at `jfk`. This plan successfully achieves the specified goal of `(at c1 jfk)`.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The custom PDDL parser demonstrated strong adaptability, highlighting the utility of bespoke parsing solutions when standard libraries present compatibility or functionality challenges.\n",
        "*   To address more complex planning problems, the BFS planner could be extended or replaced with more advanced search algorithms (e.g., A\\*) that incorporate heuristic functions to improve efficiency and scalability, especially for problems with larger state spaces or more intricate goal conditions, such as the full goal of `(and (at c1 jfk) (at c2 sfo))`.\n"

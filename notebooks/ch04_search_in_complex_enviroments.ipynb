This is exemplified in problems like the 8-queens problem, where the objective is to find a valid configuration.\n",
    "- **Applications in Various Fields**: This approach is applicable in many areas such as integrated-circuit design, factory floor layout, job scheduling, automatic programming, telecommunications, crop planning, and portfolio management.\n",
    "- **Local Search Algorithms**: These algorithms start from an initial state and move to neighboring states, without keeping track of the path or the states already explored. They are not systematic and might miss parts of the search space containing a solution.\n",

    "   - Stochastic beam search is a variation of local beam search where the selection of the k states is based on a probabilistic model rather than selecting just the top k states.\n",
    "   - This approach introduces randomness in the selection process, which can help in exploring more diverse parts of the search space and potentially finding better solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Online vs. Offline Search**:\n",
    "   - **Offline Search**: In offline search, the entire search process is completed before any action is taken. The agent first devises a complete plan based on its initial knowledge of the environment, and then executes the plan. This approach assumes that the agent has complete and accurate knowledge about the environment and the effects of its actions.\n",
    "   - **Online Search**: Online search agents, on the other hand, plan and execute actions simultaneously. They make decisions at each step based on current knowledge and then update their knowledge based on the outcome of their actions. This approach is necessary in environments where the agent cannot predict all aspects of the environment in advance or when the environment is dynamic and changes over time.\n",
    "- **Characteristics of Online Search Agents**:\n",
    "   - Online search agents operate in environments where they may not have complete information about the state of the world or the outcomes of their actions.\n",
    "   - These agents must be able to react to new information and adapt their plans accordingly, often making decisions with limited or incomplete knowledge.\n",
    "- **Mapping Problem**:\n",
    "   - The mapping problem refers to the challenge of constructing a representation (or map) of the environment based on partial or incremental observations.\n",
    "   - In online search, agents often need to map their environment while navigating it, which adds a layer of complexity to their task. This is especially common in robotic exploration, where the robot must build a map of an unknown area while simultaneously navigating through it.\n",
    "- **Decision Making in Online Search**:\n",
    "   - Online search agents must make decisions that balance exploration (gathering more information about the environment) and exploitation (using current knowledge to achieve goals).\n",

    "- **Adversary Argument**:\n",
    "   - The adversary argument is a method of analysis in online algorithms where the worst-case scenario is considered. It assumes an 'adversary' that makes the environment as challenging as possible within the rules of the problem.\n",
    "   - This approach helps in designing algorithms that are robust against the most challenging conditions.\n",
    "- **Irreversible Actions**:\n",
    "   - Irreversible actions are actions that, once taken, cannot be undone. These actions add significant complexity to online search problems since the agent must consider the long-term consequences of its actions.\n",
    "   - Strategies for dealing with irreversible actions often involve careful planning and risk assessment.\n",
    "- **Safely Explorable**:\n",
    "   - A safely explorable environment is one where the agent can explore without getting into states that are harmful or impossible to recover from (i.e., without encountering dead ends or irreversible actions).\n",
